    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Businesses have a lot of proprietary information that needs to be taken into account when answering user's questions - these cannot always be answered through the data that the GPT models have been trained on. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last notebook, we worked with structured data primarily. A lot of the time, your enterprise data is not limited to just structured formats like CSV files or SQL tables. It may also include unstructured data like PDF documents or images. In fact, your individual documents could have both unstructured and structured data built into them. Extracting information from these diverse formats in a comprehensible manner presents a challenge. Tools like Azure Form Recognizer enable the extraction of data from unstructured sources such as forms or documents. Once the data is extracted into a structured JSON format, then Cognitive Search can be utilized to consolidate the entire information from different data types into indexes, facilitating the retrieval of relevant documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk you through a use case of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that involves working with unstructured data. The RAG approach combines various technologies to enhance the quality and relevance of generated outputs. We will leverage Azure Form Recognizer to process complex documents, utilizing the layout API to extract text and tables effectively. We will utilize Azure Cognitive Search to create an index by configuring semantic search capabilities, enabling the retrieval of relevant document pages. Additionally, embeddings will be incorporated to retrieve content that is more closely aligned with the user's question. Finally, Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT model will utilize the extracted content to generate a more meaningful answer. It is important to emphasize that this grounding process follows the RAG pattern mentioned in the previous notebook and helps eliminate inaccuracies in the generated responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goals for this challenge are to read through this notebook, run each code block, observe the results, and then be able to answer the questions posed in the student guide.\n"

Prompt tuning only requires stor- ing a small task-specific prompt for each task, and enables mixed-task inference using the original pre- trained model. With a T5 “XXL” model, each copy of the tuned model requires 11 billion parameters. By contrast, our tuned prompts would only require 20,480 parameters per task—a reduction of over five orders of magnitude—assuming a prompt length of 5 tokens. low fine-tuned T5-XXL (Raffel et al., 2020) (71.8 vs. 89.3) despite using 16 times more parameters. Several efforts to automate prompt design have been recently proposed. Shin et al. (2020) propose a search algorithm over the discrete space of words, guided by the downstream application training data. While this technique outperforms manual prompt design, there is still a gap relative to model tuning. Li and Liang (2021) propose “prefix tuning” and show strong results on generative tasks. This method freezes the model parameters and back- propagates the error during tuning to prefix ac- tivations prepended to each layer in the encoder stack, including the input layer. Hambardzumyan et al. (2021) simplify this recipe by restricting the trainable parameters to the input and output sub- networks of a masked language model, and show reasonable results on classifications tasks. In this paper, we propose prompt tuning as a further simplification for adapting language models. We freeze the entire pre-trained model and only al- low an additional k tunable tokens per downstream task to be prepended to the input text. This “soft prompt” is trained end-to-end and can condense the signal from a full labeled dataset, allowing our method to outperform few-shot prompts and close the quality gap with model tuning (Figure 1). At the same time, since a single pre-trained model is recycled for all downstream tasks, we retain the ef- ficient serving benefits of frozen models (Figure 2). While we developed our method concurrently with Li and Liang (2021) and Hambardzumyan et al. (2021), we are the first to show that prompt tuning alone (with no intermediate-layer prefixes or task-specific output layers) is sufficient to be com- petitive with model tuning. Through detailed ex- periments in sections 2–3, we demonstrate that lan- guage model capacity is a key ingredient for these approaches to succeed. As Figure 1 shows, prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale. We compare with similar approaches in Sec- tion 4. Explicitly separating task-specific param- eters from the “generalist” parameters needed for general language-understanding has a range of ad- ditional benefits. We show in Section 5 that by capturing the task definition in the prompt while keeping the generalist parameters fixed, we are able to achieve better resilience to domain shifts. In Sec- tion 6, we show that “prompt ensembling”, learn- ing multiple prompts for the same task, can boost quality and is more efficient than classic model en- sembling. Finally, in Section 7, we investigate the interpretability of our learned soft prompts. In sum, our key contributions are: 1. Proposing prompt tuning and showing its com- petitiveness with model tuning in the regime of large language models. 2. Ablating many design choices, and showing quality and robustness improve with scale. 3. Showing prompt tuning outperforms model tuning on domain shift problems. 4. Proposing “prompt ensembling” and showing its effectiveness. 2 Prompt Tuning Following the “text-to-text” approach of T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), we cast all tasks as text generation. Instead of modeling classification as the probabil- ity of an output class given some input, Pr(y|X), where X is a series of tokens and y is a single class label, we now model it as conditional generation, where Y is a sequence of tokens that represent a class label. T5 models classification as Prθ(Y |X), parameterized by the weights, θ, of the transform- ers (Vaswani et al., 2017) that make up its encoder and decoder. Prompting is the approach of adding extra in- formation for the model to condition on during its generation of Y . Normally, prompting is done by prepending a series of tokens, P, to the in- put X, such that the model maximizes the likeli- hood of the correct Y , Prθ(Y |[P; X]), while keep-'}"

Question Greedy Decode Sampled Path 1 Sampled Path 2 [MultiArith] Sam had 10 socks. If he threw away 3 old ones that didn’t fit and bought 36 new ones, how many socks would he have? Sam had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones that didn’t fit. He bought 36 new ones. That means he has 10 + 36 - 3 = 41 socks. The answer is 41. Sam had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones. So now he has 7 left. Then he bought 36 new ones. So now he has 7 + 36 = 43 socks. The answer is 43. He had 10 socks. He threw away 3 old ones that didn’t fit. He bought 36 new ones. So in total he has 10 - 3 + 36 = 43 socks. The answer is 43. [SVAMP] In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boys. How many boys are there in that school? There are 697 girls and the rest are boys. That means there are 697 + 228 = 925 girls. The rest are boys. So the number of boys is 925 - 697 = 228. The answer is 228. The number of boys is the difference between 697 and 228. This is 697 - 228 = 469. The answer is 469. In the beginning there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. So, the number of boys must be 697 - 228 = 469 boys. The answer is 469. [AQuA] There are 10 oranges in a basket. Find the no. of ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket? (a) 45 (b) 90 (c) 120 (d) 150 (e) 180 There are 10 oranges in a bas- ket. So there are 10 ways in which 2 oranges are chosen from the basket. There are 10 oranges in a basket. We need to choose 2 oranges from the basket. So the number of ways are 10C2. So the answer is (a). There are 10 oranges in the bas- ket. If you choose 2 oranges, you have 10C2 = 45 ways of choosing 2 oranges. So the answer is (a). [CommonsenseQA] The man laid on the soft moss and looked up at the trees, where was the man? (a) niagra falls (b) forest (c) waterfall (d) ground (e) tree The answer must be something that is soft and mossy. Of the above choices, only ground is soft and mossy. So the answer is (d). The answer must be somewhere where moss is found. Of the above choices, only forests are known for having moss. So the answer is (b). The answer must be a place where the man is laying down and look- ing up at trees. Of the above choices, only forest is a place where people lay down and look at trees. So the answer is (b). [ARC] Which of these will most likely harm a habitat? (a) plant- ing trees. (b) water pollution. (c) rainfall. (d) sunlight. Planting trees will not harm a habitat. So the answer is (a). The answer is (b), water pollution, because it will most likely harm the habi- tat. The other answers are not likely to harm the habi- tat. The answer is (b), water pollution. Trees are good for a habitat, rain- fall is necessary for a habitat, and sunlight is necessary for a habitat. So the answer is (b). [ARC-challenge] Which pro- cess in the carbon cycle takes the longest to complete? (a) emis- sion of waste. (b) respiration in animals. (c) photosynthesis in plants. (d) formation of fossil fu- els. The process of photosynthesis in plants takes the longest to complete. So the answer is (c). The formation of fossil fu- els takes the longest time to complete. So the an- swer is (d). The process that takes the longest time to complete is the forma- tion of fossil fuels, which hap- pens over millions of years. So the answer is (d). Table 12: Additional examples where self-consistency helps repair the errors over greedy decode on LaMDA-137B. Two sampled reasoning paths that are consistent with the ground truth are shown. A.2 FULL SETS OF PROMPTS We list the full details of the prompts used for two newly-introduced datasets, AQUA-RAT (Ling et al., 2017) and AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC) (Clark et al., 2018), where we manually composed the example chains of thought in this paper, in Table 14 and Table 15, respectively. As additional information, we also list the exact set of prompts used for all arithmetic reasoning tasks in Table 17, since there are multiple sets of prompts introduced in Wei et al. (2022). The prompts for CommonsenseQA and StrategyQA are the same as used in Wei et al. (2022). We provide the exact prompts used for common NLP tasks in the following tables as well, including NLI and Closed-Book Question-Answering tasks.', 'Self-Consistency Improves Chain of Thought Reasoning in Language Models Prompt with correct chain-of-thought 17.1 LaMDA-137B Prompt with imperfect chain-of-thought 14.9 + Self-consistency (40 paths) 23.4 Prompt with equations 5.0 + Self-consistency (40 paths) 6.5 PaLM-540B Zero-shot CoT (Kojima et al., 2022) + Self-consistency (40 paths) 43.0 69.2 Table 8: Self-consistency works under imperfect prompts, equa- tion prompts and zero-shot chain-of-thought for GSM8K. 100 Accuracy (%) 80 60 40 20 0 0 20 40 60 100 80 Consistency (%) Figure 5: The consistency is cor- related with model’s accuracy. and less opportunity remains for generating diversity in the decoding process. In addition, we tested self-consistency with zero-shot chain-of-thought (Kojima et al., 2022) and show that self-consistency works for zero-shot CoT as well and improves the results significantly (+26.2%) in Table 8. 4 RELATED WORK Reasoning in language models. Language models are known to struggle in Type 2 tasks, such as arithmetic, logical and commonsense reasoning (Evans, 2010). Previous work has primarily focused on specialized approaches for improving reasoning (Andor et al., 2019; Ran et al., 2019; Geva et al., 2020; Pi˛ekos et al., 2021). Compared to prior work, self-consistency is applicable to a wide range of reasoning tasks without any additional supervision or fine-tuning, while still substantially improving the performance of the chain-of-thought prompting approach proposed in Wei et al. (2022). Sampling and re-ranking in language models. Multiple decoding strategies for language models have been proposed in the literature, e.g., temperature sampling (Ackley et al., 1985; Ficler & Goldberg, 2017), top-k sampling (Fan et al., 2018; Holtzman et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019), nucleus sampling (Holtzman et al., 2020), minimum Bayes risk decoding (Eikema & Aziz, 2020), and typical decoding (Meister et al., 2022). Other work has sought to explicitly promote diversity in the decoding process (Batra et al., 2012; Li et al., 2016; Vijayakumar et al., 2018). Re-ranking is another common approach to improve generation quality in language models (Adiwar- dana et al., 2020; Shen et al., 2021). Thoppilan et al. (2022) collect additional human annotations to train a re-ranker for response filtering. Cobbe et al. (2021) train a “verifier” to re-rank generated solutions, which substantially improves the solve rate on math tasks compared to just fine-tuning the language model. Elazar et al. (2021) improve the consistency of factual knowledge extraction by extending pre-training with an additional consistency loss. All these methods require either training an additional re-ranker or collecting additional human annotation, while self-consistency requires no additional training, fine-tuning, nor extra data collection. Extract reasoning paths. Some previous work has considered task-specific approaches for iden- tifying reasoning paths, such as constructing semantic graphs (Xu et al., 2021a), learning an RNN to retrieve reasoning paths over the Wikipedia graph (Asai et al., 2020), fine-tuning with human annotated reasoning paths on math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021), or training an extractor with heuristic-based pseudo reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019). More recently, the importance of di- versity in the reasoning processes has been noticed, but only leveraged via task-specific training, either through an additional QA model over extracted reasoning paths (Chen et al., 2019), or by the introduction of latent variables in a commonsense knowledge graph (Yu et al., 2022). Compared to these approaches, self-consistency is far simpler and requires no additional training. The approach we propose simply couples the generation of reasoning paths and a final answer by sampling from the decoder, using aggregation to recover the most consistent answer without additional modules. Consistency in language models. Some prior work has shown that language models can suffer from inconsistency in conversation (Adiwardana et al., 2020), explanation generation (Camburu et al., 2020), and factual knowledge extraction (Elazar et al., 2021). Welleck et al. (2020) use “consistency” to refer to generating an infinite-length sequence in recurrent language models. Nye et al. (2021) improve the logical consistency of samples from a System 1 model by adding a System 2-inspired logical reasoning module. In this paper we focus on a slightly different notion of “consistency”, i.e., utilizing answer consistency among diverse reasoning paths to improve accuracy.', 'Table 24: Few-shot exemplars for full chain of thought prompt for CSQA. There are newlines between the answer choices that are omitted in the table for space reasons. PROMPT FOR CSQA Q: What do people use to absorb extra ink from a fountain pen?
